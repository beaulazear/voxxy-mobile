# App Store Content Moderation Compliance

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of content moderation features required by Apple App Store Guidelines 1.2 - Safety - User-Generated Content. These changes ensure Voxxy Mobile meets all requirements for apps with user-generated content.

## Apple's Requirements vs Our Implementation

### ✅ Requirement 1: Terms of Service (EULA) with Zero Tolerance Policy

**Apple Requires:** Users must agree to terms that make it clear there is no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users.

**What We Implemented:**
- **New EULA Modal** (`components/EULAModal.js`)
  - Displays on first app launch and after updates
  - Explicit "Zero Tolerance Policy" section
  - Clear list of prohibited content:
    - Harassment or bullying
    - Hate speech or discrimination  
    - Inappropriate or offensive content
    - Spam or scams
  - Enforcement consequences clearly stated
  - Requires explicit agreement to both Terms of Service AND Community Guidelines
  - Stores acceptance in AsyncStorage with version tracking

**How This Helps Pass Review:**
- Apple reviewers will see the EULA immediately when testing the app
- The "zero tolerance" language directly addresses their requirement
- Two separate checkboxes ensure users understand both terms and content policies

---

### ✅ Requirement 2: Method for Filtering Objectionable Content

**Apple Requires:** A proactive method to filter objectionable content before it appears.

**What We Implemented:**
- **Content Filter Service** (`services/ContentFilterService.js`)
  - Real-time profanity detection
  - Blocks comments containing:
    - Profanity and inappropriate language
    - Hate speech and slurs
    - Spam patterns (excessive URLs, caps, repetition)
  - Validates all comments before posting
  - Shows user-friendly error messages

**How This Helps Pass Review:**
- Reviewers can test by trying to post inappropriate content
- System immediately blocks and explains why
- Demonstrates proactive content protection

---

### ✅ Requirement 3: Mechanism for Users to Flag Objectionable Content

**Apple Requires:** Users must be able to report inappropriate content.

**What We Implemented:**
- **Report Button on Every Comment**
  - Three-dot menu icon on each comment (except user's own)
  - Report modal with categories:
    - Spam or misleading
    - Harassment or bullying
    - Hate speech or discrimination
    - Inappropriate or offensive
    - Violence or dangerous content
    - Other (with text field)
  - Confirmation message promising 24-hour review

**How This Helps Pass Review:**
- Visible and accessible reporting mechanism
- Professional categorization system
- Clear commitment to review timeline

---

### ✅ Requirement 4: Mechanism for Users to Block Abusive Users

**Apple Requires:** Users must be able to block other users.

**What We Implemented:**
- **User Blocking System** (`services/BlockedUsersService.js`)
  - "Block User" button in report modal
  - Confirmation dialog explaining consequences
  - Immediately hides all content from blocked users
  - Persists blocks in local storage
  - Works offline

**How This Helps Pass Review:**
- Clear blocking option for each user interaction
- Immediate effect (content disappears)
- User empowerment for safety

---

### ✅ Requirement 5: 24-Hour Response to Reports

**Apple Requires:** Developer must act on reports within 24 hours by removing content and ejecting offending users.

**What We Implemented:**
- **Frontend Reporting Infrastructure**
  - Reports sent to `/reports` API endpoint
  - Includes all necessary data:
    - Content type and ID
    - Reason for report
    - Reporter information
    - Activity context
  - User receives confirmation of 24-hour review promise

**Backend Requirements (You Need to Implement):**
```javascript
// Example endpoint structure
POST /reports
{
  "report": {
    "reportable_type": "comment",
    "reportable_id": 123,
    "reason": "harassment",
    "reporter_id": 456,
    "activity_id": 789
  }
}
```

**Operational Requirements:**
1. Set up email/Slack notifications for new reports
2. Create admin dashboard or process to review reports
3. Log all moderation actions with timestamps
4. Implement user suspension/ban system

**How This Helps Pass Review:**
- Clear commitment in EULA and report confirmation
- System ready to handle reports
- You just need to ensure operational response

## Testing Guide for App Review

When Apple reviews your app, they will likely test:

1. **EULA Display**
   - ✅ App shows EULA on first launch
   - ✅ Cannot proceed without accepting both checkboxes

2. **Content Filtering**
   - ✅ Try posting profanity → Blocked with error message
   - ✅ Try posting spam → Blocked with error message

3. **Reporting Flow**
   - ✅ Tap three dots on any comment → Report option appears
   - ✅ Select reason → Submit → Confirmation message

4. **Blocking Users**
   - ✅ Report comment → Block user option visible
   - ✅ Block user → Their content disappears

5. **24-Hour Commitment**
   - ✅ EULA states 24-hour response
   - ✅ Report confirmation promises 24-hour review

## Quick Backend Implementation Guide

To complete the system, implement these on your Rails backend:

### 1. Reports Table Migration
```ruby
class CreateReports < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :reports do |t|
      t.string :reportable_type
      t.integer :reportable_id
      t.string :reason
      t.text :description
      t.integer :reporter_id
      t.integer :activity_id
      t.string :status, default: 'pending'
      t.datetime :resolved_at
      t.integer :resolved_by_id
      t.text :resolution_notes
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

### 2. Reports Controller
```ruby
class ReportsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    report = Report.create!(report_params)
    ReportMailer.new_report(report).deliver_later
    render json: { status: 'success', message: 'Report submitted' }
  end

  private
  def report_params
    params.require(:report).permit(:reportable_type, :reportable_id, 
                                   :reason, :reporter_id, :activity_id)
  end
end
```

### 3. Email Notification
```ruby
class ReportMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def new_report(report)
    @report = report
    mail(to: 'moderation@voxxyai.com', 
         subject: 'URGENT: New Content Report - 24hr Response Required')
  end
end
```

### 4. Simple Admin Dashboard
Create a simple web interface or use Rails Admin to:
- View pending reports
- Delete reported content
- Ban users
- Mark reports as resolved

## Response Template for App Review

Include this in your App Review notes:

> We have implemented comprehensive content moderation features including:

## Maintenance Notes

- Review and update profanity filter list monthly
- Monitor report patterns for new types of abuse
- Keep EULA version updated when policies change
- Document all moderation actions for potential appeals
- Consider implementing ML-based content detection in future

This implementation satisfies all Apple requirements for user-generated content and should resolve the review rejection.

## üéâ Completed Work

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Profile Completion & Incentives (COMPLETE)

  - Displays "Complete your profile to get better recommendations"
  - Lists missing items dynamically (e.g., "‚Ä¢ Add favorite foods")
  - Only displays when < 100% complete
  - Full implementation with `useMemo` hook for performance

### ‚úÖ New Feature: Solo vs Group Activity Creation

#### Activity Creation Flow (`UnifiedActivityChat.js`)
- ‚úÖ **Added "Who's joining?" step** (Step 3 of 4)
  - Two options: "Just me" (solo) or "Invite others" (group)
  - Visual cards with User/Users icons
  - Sets `is_solo` flag on activity creation
  - Updated totalSteps to 4 (was 3)
  - Flow: Activity Type ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Who's Joining ‚Üí Time ‚Üí Submit

#### Backend Support (Rails API)
- ‚úÖ **Database migration** (`db/migrate/20251013181038_add_is_solo_to_activities.rb`)
  - Added `is_solo` boolean column to activities table
  - Default: false, null: false
  - Migration successfully run

- ‚úÖ **Controller updates** (`activities_controller.rb` line 198)
  - Added `:is_solo` to permitted parameters
  - Activity creation and updates support the new field

- ‚úÖ **Serializer updates** (`activity_serializer.rb` line 6)
  - Added `:is_solo` to ACTIVITY_FIELDS array
  - All serializer methods include the field (basic, created, updated, list_item, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Major Feature: ActivitiesScreen Redesign (COMPLETE)

#### Filter System Overhaul
- ‚úÖ **Changed filters from "Active/Finalized/Invites" ‚Üí "Groups/Solo/Finalized"**
  - **Groups tab**: Shows all non-finalized group activities (!is_solo) + pending invites at the top
  - **Solo tab**: Shows all non-finalized solo activities (is_solo = true)
  - **Finalized tab**: Shows all finalized activities (both group and solo)
  - Invites now prominently displayed at top of Groups tab with purple glow styling
  - Default filter: 'groups'

#### Activity Card Design Improvements
- ‚úÖ **Moved activity type icon from left to right**
  - Icon now appears on right side of card, vertically centered
  - Changed `alignItems: 'flex-start'` ‚Üí `'center'` on listItem
  - Updated margins: icon has `marginLeft: 16` instead of `marginRight`

- ‚úÖ **Added location display**
  - Shows parsed location with MapPin icon
  - Smart parsing: coordinates ‚Üí "Near you", full addresses ‚Üí city/neighborhood
  - Positioned below activity title

- ‚úÖ **Added stacked avatar display for groups**
  - Shows up to 4 member avatars with -10px overlap (Instagram-style)
  - "+X" counter badge for groups with >4 members
  - Displays "{count} people" or "1 person" text

  - Shows single avatar with "Just you" text
  - Clean, minimal design

- ‚úÖ **Countdown timer for finalized activities**
  - **Replaces activity icon on right side** for finalized activities
  - Shows countdown: "5d 3h 45m", "3h 45m", "45m" format
  - Displays "Started" for past events
  - Yellow badge styling with border
  - Only appears when `countdownTs` exists (finalized with date/time)

#### Code Organization
- ‚úÖ **Location parsing utility** (lines 68-86)
  - Handles coordinate format detection
  - Extracts city/neighborhood from full addresses
  - Fallback to "Location TBD" or "Location set"

- ‚úÖ **Member aggregation logic** (lines 174-176)
  - Combines host and participants into single array

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Summary

### Current Data Flow

#### Activities/Groups Structure
```javascript
activity: {
  id, activity_name, activity_type,
  activity_location, date_day, date_time,
  user_id, user,
  completed, finalized, voting,
  is_solo: boolean, // NEW!
  participants: [...],
  responses: [...],
  pinned_activities: [...]
}
```

#### Filter Logic (ActivitiesScreen.js)
```javascript
// Groups tab: non-finalized group activities + invites
groupActivities = activities.filter(a => !a.finalized && !a.is_solo)
invites = participant_activities.filter(p => !p.accepted)
filteredActivities = [...invites, ...groupActivities]

// Solo tab: non-finalized solo activities
soloActivities = activities.filter(a => !a.finalized && a.is_solo)

// Finalized tab: all finalized (group + solo)
finalizedActivities = activities.filter(a => a.finalized)
```

#### Avatar Display Logic
```javascript
// Combines host + participants, deduplicates
const allMembers = [item.user, ...(item.participants || [])].filter(Boolean);
const uniqueMembers = [...new Map(allMembers.map(m => [m.id, m])).values()];
```

### Component Files Modified
1. **ProfileScreen.js** - Profile completion banner
2. **UnifiedActivityChat.js** - Solo/group selection step
3. **ActivitiesScreen.js** - Complete redesign with filters, avatars, countdown
4. **Rails Backend** - Migration, controller, serializer for is_solo

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Invites stay in Groups tab** - Makes sense since invites are always group activities
2. **Countdown replaces icon** - Cleaner UI, countdown is more important for finalized events
3. **Icon moved to right** - Better visual hierarchy with content on left
4. **Keep Activity table name** - No database rename, only UI terminology change
5. **Default filter is "Groups"** - Most common use case

### Technical Debt:
- None currently - clean implementation

### Future Considerations:
- May want to add real-time countdown updates (setInterval)
- Consider adding "days until" for events far in the future
- May want to collapse past finalized events after a certain time
- Could add quick actions (edit, delete, find new spot) as swipe gestures

**Ready to proceed with Phase 2 (Terminology Updates)!**

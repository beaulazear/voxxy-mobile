## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **No In-App Privacy Policy**
- **Issue**: Privacy policy only exists on web app, not accessible within the mobile app
- **Requirement**: Apple requires privacy policy access both in App Store Connect AND within the app

### 2. **Missing Privacy Consent Flow**
- **Issue**: App collects data immediately without explicit user consent
- **Requirement**: Must get user consent before collecting any data

### 3. **Insufficient Permission Descriptions**
- **Issue**: Info.plist usage descriptions don't fully explain data usage
- **Requirement**: Must clearly state what data is collected, how it's used, and if it's shared

### 4. **Automatic Data Collection**
- **Issue**: Push tokens, location, and other data collected automatically
- **Requirement**: All data collection must be opt-in with user control

### 5. **No Data Management Features**
- **Issue**: No way for users to manage, export, or delete their data
- **Requirement**: Users must be able to withdraw consent and manage their data

## Notes on Your Current Implementation

### What You're Doing Right:
- Privacy policy exists and is comprehensive
- Permission usage descriptions are present
- Using AsyncStorage for secure local storage

### What Needs Improvement:
- Privacy policy must be accessible in-app
- Need explicit consent before data collection
- Permission descriptions need more detail about data sharing
- Need user controls for data management
- Push notifications shouldn't auto-register

Remember: Apple takes privacy very seriously. It's better to over-communicate and give users more control than risk another rejection.

## üîß NEEDS FIXING - Critical Issues

### 1. **Console Logs in Production Code** üö®
**Impact:** Will fail Apple's code review
**Found:** 10 console.log statements in component files

**Files with console.logs:**
- `components/NativeMapView.js` - 7 instances
- `components/TestMap.js` - 3 instances

**Fix Required:**
```bash
# Run the existing script to clean logs
npm run logs:clean

# Or manually remove them from:
components/NativeMapView.js (lines 76, 91, 123, 139, 263, 264, 320)
components/TestMap.js (lines 29, 32, 35)
```

### 2. **TestMap Component** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Impact:** Test code in production
**Location:** `components/TestMap.js` imported in `AIRecommendations.js`

**Fix Required:**
```bash
# Remove the test import from AIRecommendations.js
# Line with: import TestMap from './TestMap'; // Temporary test
# Then delete TestMap.js
rm components/TestMap.js
```

### 3. **API Configuration** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current Setting:** Points to production API (https://www.voxxyai.com/)
**Issue:** You mentioned the API might not be running yet

**Verify Before Submission:**
- Ensure API is deployed and running
- Test all endpoints
- Verify HTTPS certificates
- Check rate limiting is configured

### 4. **Environment File** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current:** `.env` has `APP_ENV=development`
**Fix Required:**
```bash
# For production builds, update .env:
API_URL=https://www.voxxyai.com/
APP_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=error
```

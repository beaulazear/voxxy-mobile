- `suspended_until` (datetime) - nullable
- `suspension_reason` (text) - nullable
- `ban_reason` (text) - nullable
- `terms_accepted_at` (datetime)
- `terms_version` (string)
- `content_guidelines_accepted_at` (datetime)

### API Endpoints:

#### GET /me
Response must include:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name",

  "suspension_reason": "Violation of community guidelines",
  "ban_reason": null,
  "push_notifications": true
}
```

## 2. Reports System

### Report Model:
```ruby
class Report < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :reporter, class_name: 'User'
  belongs_to :reportable, polymorphic: true # User, Activity, Comment
  belongs_to :activity, optional: true # For context
  
  validates :reason, presence: true
  validates :reportable_type, inclusion: { in: ['User', 'Activity', 'Comment'] }
  
  enum status: {
    pending: 0,
    reviewing: 1,
    resolved: 2,
    dismissed: 3
  }
  
  enum reason: {
    spam: 0,
    harassment: 1,
    hate: 2,
    inappropriate: 3,
    violence: 4,
    misinformation: 5,
    privacy: 6,
    other: 7
  }
end
```

### API Endpoints:

#### POST /reports
Request:
```json
{
  "report": {
    "reportable_type": "User|Activity|Comment",
    "reportable_id": 123,
    "reason": "harassment",
    "description": "Details about the violation",
    "activity_id": 456 // optional, for context
  }
}
```

Response: 201 Created
```json
{
  "id": 789,
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2024-01-10T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## 3. Content Filtering

### Server-Side Requirements:

#### Comment Validation:
- Profanity filtering (server-side backup to client filtering)
- Spam detection
- URL limit enforcement (max 2 URLs per comment)
- Character limit (500 chars)
- Minimum length (1 char after trimming)

#### Activity Creation/Update:
- Filter activity names and descriptions
- Validate welcome messages
- Check for prohibited content patterns

### Implementation Example:
```ruby
class ContentFilter
  PROFANITY_LIST = [...] # Comprehensive list
  SPAM_PATTERNS = [
    /bit\.ly/i,
    /click here/i,
    /buy now/i,
    # etc.
  ]
  
  def self.contains_profanity?(text)
    # Check against profanity list
  end
  
  def self.contains_spam?(text)
    # Check against spam patterns
  end
  
  def self.clean_text(text)
    # Replace profanity with asterisks
  end
end
```

## 4. User Blocking (Server Support)

### BlockedUser Model:
```ruby
class BlockedUser < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blocker, class_name: 'User'
  belongs_to :blocked, class_name: 'User'
  
  validates :blocker_id, uniqueness: { scope: :blocked_id }
end
```

### API Endpoints:

#### POST /users/:user_id/block
Response: 200 OK

#### DELETE /users/:user_id/unblock
Response: 200 OK

#### GET /users/blocked
Response:
```json
{
  "blocked_users": [
    { "id": 123, "name": "Blocked User" }
  ]
}
```

### Content Filtering by Blocks:
- Filter out comments from blocked users in API responses
- Exclude blocked users from activity participant lists
- Hide activities created by blocked users

## 5. Moderation Actions

### Admin/Moderation Endpoints:

#### POST /admin/users/:id/suspend
Request:
```json
{
  "duration_hours": 24,
  "reason": "Harassment of other users"
}
```

#### POST /admin/users/:id/ban
Request:
```json
{
  "reason": "Severe violation - hate speech"
}
```

#### POST /admin/users/:id/reinstate
Removes suspension/ban

#### GET /admin/reports
Returns all pending reports for moderation

#### PATCH /admin/reports/:id/resolve
Request:
```json
{
  "action": "suspend_user|ban_user|remove_content|dismiss",
  "notes": "Action taken details"
}
```

## 6. Automated Moderation

### Background Jobs (using Sidekiq/DelayedJob):

#### Report Processing Job
- Run every hour
- Auto-escalate reports older than 20 hours
- Send alerts to moderators for high-priority reports

#### Content Scanning Job
- Scan new content for violations
- Auto-flag suspicious content for review
- Track violation patterns per user

### Moderation Rules Engine:
```ruby
class ModerationRulesEngine
  def self.evaluate_user(user)
    if user.total_reports_received >= 10
      # Auto-suspend for review
    elsif user.total_reports_received >= 5
      # Flag for moderator attention
    end
  end
  
  def self.evaluate_content(content)
    severity = calculate_severity(content)
    case severity
    when :severe
      # Immediate removal + user suspension
    when :moderate
      # Flag for review
    when :mild
      # Warning to user
    end
  end
end
```

## 7. Audit Trail

### Required Logging:
- All moderation actions
- Report submissions and resolutions
- User blocks/unblocks
- Content removals
- Terms acceptance

### AuditLog Model:
```ruby
class AuditLog < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user, optional: true
  belongs_to :moderator, class_name: 'User', optional: true
  belongs_to :target, polymorphic: true
  
  # Log all moderation events
end
```

## 8. Required API Response Codes

### Moderation-Related Status Codes:
- 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons (for banned users)
- 403 Forbidden (for suspended users with clear error message)
- 422 Unprocessable Entity (for content violations)

### Error Response Format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "USER_SUSPENDED",
    "message": "Your account is suspended until 2024-01-15",
    "suspended_until": "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z",
    "reason": "Community guidelines violation"
  }
}
```

## 9. Dashboard Requirements

### Moderator Dashboard Endpoints:

#### GET /admin/dashboard
Returns:
- Pending reports count
- Reports by category
- Recent moderation actions
- Users flagged for review

#### GET /admin/metrics
Returns:
- Reports resolved within 24 hours percentage
- Average resolution time
- Top reported users
- Content violation trends

## 10. Email Notifications

### Required Email Templates:

## Testing Requirements:

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Content filter accuracy
   - Report creation and validation
   - User suspension/ban logic
   - Blocking functionality

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Full report workflow
   - Moderation action effects
   - Content filtering in API responses
   - User state transitions

3. **Performance Tests:**
   - Report processing within 24 hours

## Compliance Notes:

1. **24-Hour Response Time:** Implement automated escalation for reports approaching 24-hour mark
2. **Zero Tolerance:** Severe violations should trigger immediate action
3. **Appeal Process:** Must have clear appeal workflow with reasonable response time
4. **Data Privacy:** Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance in report handling
5. **Transparency:** Users should understand why action was taken against them
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Recommendations

### Mobile App (Current State):
Your mobile app implementation looks solid and should pass iOS review. All required features are present:
- âœ… EULA with zero tolerance clearly stated
- âœ… Content filtering mechanisms
- âœ… User reporting system
- âœ… User blocking capability
- âœ… Proper handling of suspended/banned accounts

### Minor Enhancements to Consider:
1. Add version checking for EULA (force re-acceptance on updates)
2. Consider adding a "Report User" option directly from user profiles
3. Add rate limiting for report submissions to prevent abuse
4. Consider implementing a local cache of reported content IDs to hide them immediately

### Backend Requirements:
Share the Rails API Requirements document above with your backend team to ensure all endpoints and functionality are properly implemented. The most critical items are:
1. Report creation and 24-hour resolution workflow
2. User suspension/ban system with proper API responses
3. Content filtering at the server level
4. Audit trail for all moderation actions

Your app should pass iOS review with these implementations!
